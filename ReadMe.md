# Source

SMSource You can build projects and sources according to your project and dreams

And before you follow his readers

You must agree to the terms and conditions In INFO.md

To make anything and not just a source No it's more than that

You need experience or something simple to share

This means that this is not an application or an application engine
It's a source folder
You can create any project

Literally any project

Games, applications, animations, movies, designs, programmers, video, images, gamers, or operating systems.

Anything you integrate with your engine, application, games, codes, or create your own way

There are no scripts or software, just asses on a source

This is not a Source Code but the Source Itself

We hope you understand this and

We will be with you so that you do not lose your dreams forever

Good Luck :)
